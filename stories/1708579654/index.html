        <img src="./0.png" /><br/><h3>Once upon a time, in a quaint little village nestled between rolling hills, lived a curious and adventurous boy named Gavin. He was known for his insatiable curiosity and his unyielding spirit.</h3><img src="./1.png" /><br/><h3>One sunny afternoon, as Gavin sat by the village pond watching the colorful fish swim, he spotted a shiny object glinting at the bottom. His heart raced with excitement as he imagined what treasure it could be!</h3><img src="./2.png" /><br/><h3>With great care and determination, Gavin gathered some long sticks and tied them together to create a makeshift fishing rod. He then embarked on his quest to retrieve the mysterious object.</h3><img src="./3.png" /><br/><h3>As Gavin approached the edge of the pond, he noticed an old, gnarled tree with a large knotted root jutting out over the water. With a determined look in his eyes, he cast his makeshift rod towards the tree and waited with bated breath.</h3><img src="./4.png" /><br/><h3>Suddenly, there was a splash! Gavin's heart skipped a beat as he reeled in his line, his eyes wide with wonder as he beheld the most beautiful, iridescent stone he had ever seen.</h3>
